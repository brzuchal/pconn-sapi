pconnect tester for PHP

This is a small tool helping while testing persistent connections with PHP,
without the need for installing and configuring a web server and the
complexity added by such a web server.

This tool simulates  multiple requests by running a PHP script multiple times
simulating multiple requests. The executed script can then open persistent
connections and verify the connection on following requests.

This simplifies automation of tests and memory checking.

Installation

To install this tool you have to first compile PHP's embed SAPI as shared object
(./configure --enable-embed=shared) and then link this code against the
generated library.
