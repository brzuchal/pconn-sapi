pconnect tester for PHP

This is a small tool helping while testing persistent connections with PHP,
without the need for installing and configuring a web server and the
complexity added by such a web server.

This tool simulates  multiple requests by running a PHP script multiple times
simulating multiple requests. The executed script can then open persistent
connections and verify the connection on following requests.

This simplifies automation of tests and memory checking.

Installation

For installation put this code into a directory sapi/pconn inside a PHP
source tree, then run `./buildconf` and `./configure` PHP using the
--enable-pconn switch. For testing multithreading make use of
the --enable-maintainer-zts switch.

When running `make` a binary `sapi/pconn/pconn` is created.

Trivial usage sample:

This package includes a simple sample:
$ ./pconnect-test -a samples/start.php -z samples/shutdown.php -n10 samples/main.php 

If your PHP was compiled with --enable-maintainer-zts you can run multiple
threads:
$ ./pconnect-test -a samples/start.php -z samples/shutdown.php -n10 -t5 samples/main.php
